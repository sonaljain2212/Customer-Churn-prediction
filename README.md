# Customer-Churn-prediction


- What is churn analysis?
Churn analysis is the evaluation of a companyâ€™s customer loss rate in order to reduce it. Also referred to as customer attrition rate, churn can be minimized by assessing your product and how people use it.


In this project, I aim to predict retention rate for a job board dataset. The proportion of custormer churned and retained is 26.9 to 73.1 %. The shape of the dataset is (37757, 15).

It is a classification problem and I have used two standard baseline models to observe the model performance with the unbalanced dataset. The aim is the predict the retention rate for the models:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
